        The Slack bot that brings your team together!

HighFive is a recognition system for Slack. Your team members reward each others and win gifts.

**Born and bread in Texas**

## How it all works

​Every day, each team member receives five :highfive: that can be used to reward a fellow colleague. Send recognition in a channel (public or private).

> ​A big thanks :highfive: to @mike for completing the merger!

Mike will receive a direct message from the bot informing him of the recognition.

> @larry gave you a :highfive:

And the sender will receive a confirmation

> You gave a :highfive: to @mike

When you have enough :highfive:s, you can exchange them for gifts.

You can configure all the gifts you want in HighFive, some ideas:

- Gift Cards (Amazon, Starbucks, iTunes, etc.)
- Lunch with CEO
- Anything you can imagine!

### Rules

- You can give several rewards (​:hatching_chick:​ ​:hatching_chick:​to @john)
- ​You can give reward to several people (​:hatching_chick:​ to @john and @jim)
- You can not give reward you you dont have !
- ​You can accumulate :hatching_chick: (but a maximum is set)
- You can not give reward you received (:hatched_chick:)
- ​You can not give :hatching_chick: in a direct message.

###Configure you bot and get you token

[In Slack, create a bot](https://slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration) named `dairy` and copy the API token.

**Invite dairy in each channel** needed to be monitored by your bot. You also need to create a private chanel `dairyadmin` and invite your bot inside with `/invite dairy`.

If you want to make reward easier, [create a alias](https://slack.com/customize/emoji) `:thanks:` for the one you use `:hatching_chick:` by default (:hatching_chick:)

##Launch
###Test
DairyBotToken=xoxp-123456-789012-??????-?????? node dairybot.js
###Install as a daemon
Ìnstall [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to make DairyBot persistent.
```
[sudo] npm install forever -g
```
Create `/etc/init.d/dairybot`.
Change the **DairyBotToken** and the **sourceDir**

```
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:             dairybot
# Required-Start:       $syslog $remote_fs
# Required-Stop:        $syslog $remote_fs

# Description:          The ChatBot that makes your team happy
### END INIT INFO

#/etc/init.d/dairybot

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/usr/local/lib/node_modules
# change du token below with yours
export DairyBotToken=xoxb-12345678-azertyuiopQSDFGHJKLM 

case "$1" in
  start)
  # change --sourceDir to set the path where you install dairybot
  exec forever --uid="dairybot" --sourceDir=/home/fermier/dairybot -p /var/run/fermier.pid dairybot.js 2>&1 > /dev/null &
  ;;
stop)
  exec forever stop dairybot 2>&1 > /dev/null
  ;;
*)
  echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/dairybot {start|stop}"
  exit 1
  ;;
esac

exit 0
```

Launch the daemon
```
/etc/init.d/dairybot start
```


###Restart

You can restart the daemon in command line to reload the configuration
```
/etc/init.d/dairybot stop
/etc/init.d/dairybot start
```

Or DM your bot in Slack, and say `restart` and confirm `yes`

## FAQ

### Dairybot didn't see some rewards

The bot need to be invited in each channal public ou private. You can also check if the bot is launched (the green bullet)

The bot can not see if you try to give reward through a direct message, Slack didn't allow it.



## How to contributes

You can help correcting typos, or complete the documentation, or even create new language (json file in /config).

I also want to create guides for easy installation on Paas ([Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku), [Google cloud platform](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/03/three-ways-to-build-Slack-integrations-on-Google-Cloud-Platform.html), IBM [BlueMix](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/06/06/slack-bots-built-using-node-red/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/using-the-azure-webjobs-sdk-to-create-custom-slack-extensions/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/lambda/), [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/nodejs/nodejs/), DigitalOcean, Gandi...)

You can help to impove the code, of course. I'm new to NodeJS, it's realy a side project for me and I didn't plan to be a Node expert ;-). Pull request are welcome !

###Librairy

DairyBot is based on the Botkit library https://howdy.ai/botkit/
